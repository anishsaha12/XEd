        How to open a bank Account:\n\n
Select your type of account. There are usually 2 types of accounts:\n
A. A Savings Account\n
B. A current Account\n\n
A savings Account basically helps you gain intrest on the money you store in the bank,
        But you would require a minimum amount in the abnk at all times.
A current account is based for daily uses and has no lower limit and neither does it provide an Intrest.\n\n\n

Next you have to provide your personal details along with relevant proof.\n
The proofs required include an ID proof and an Address proof.\n\n
Of recently banks require your aadhar number also to make the process smoother.\n
You will also need to supply them with a photograph and fill up a form for the application.\n\n
If you are a minor then you would need your parents to sign off and be the custodians till you become 18 years.\n\n
You then put in your initial balance into the account by either giving a draft or cash.\n
You then wait for a couple of business days till you recieve your cheque book and accompanying kit.\n\n\n

Thats all for bank account creation.\n

    <string name="deposit">
Methods of Depositing:\n\n

    form available at the counter to deposit money through cash.\n
 b. Demand Draft or Cashiers Cheque: You can Deposit cash that
    is verified by a teller by providing a DD.\n
 c. Online transfer: One can transfer using online portal from
    another account provided you have the account number, NEFT
    or IFSC codes.\n
 d. Cheques: You can deposit a cheque with you account number
    and contact details written at the back and get the money
    deposited in 3-4 business days.\n
    </string>

    <string name="withdraw">
Withdrawing cash:\n\n
 a. Cash: Again you can use the ATM with your debit card to get
    the cash. Or fill up a form at your bank branch and request
    the teller to provide you with the cash.\n
 b. Demand Draft: Provide the details of whom the money is
    supposed to be given to and the reason the teller then
    generates an official note that can then be deposited by the
    other party directly into his account.\n
 c. Cheque: Draw up a cheque in favour of your reciepient or a
    self addressed cheque and give it to the other person.\n

    <string name="invOpportunities">
Investment Opportunities:\n\n\n
A customer of the bank can invest in any of the following options:\n\n
 a. Fixed Deposits: These are deposits into a bank that can be
    frozen in for a period of time and they accumulate interest
    over this period.\n
 b. Bonds: These are government sponsored guarantees that so much
    amount will be payed with a particular amount of intrest.\n
 c. Stock Options: Buying a share in a particular company and
    investing based on the profits or losses of that company and
    its performance in the market.\n

        "Material is the metaphor.\n\n"

        "A material metaphor is the unifying theory of a rationalized space and a system of motion."
        "The material is grounded in tactile reality, inspired by the study of paper and ink, yet "
        "technologically advanced and open to imagination and magic.\n"
        "Surfaces and edges of the material provide visual cues that are grounded in reality. The "
        "use of familiar tactile attributes helps users quickly understand affordances. Yet the "
        "flexibility of the material creates new affordances that supercede those in the physical "
        "world, without breaking the rules of physics.\n"
        "The fundamentals of light, surface, and movement are key to conveying how objects move, "
        "interact, and exist in space and in relation to each other. Realistic lighting shows "
        "seams, divides space, and indicates moving parts.\n\n"

        "Bold, graphic, intentional.\n\n"

        "The foundational elements of print based design typography, grids, space, scale, color, "
        "and use of imagery guide visual treatments. These elements do far more than please the "
        "eye. They create hierarchy, meaning, and focus. Deliberate color choices, edge to edge "
        "imagery, large scale typography, and intentional white space create a bold and graphic "
        "interface that immerse the user in the experience.\n"
        "An emphasis on user actions makes core functionality immediately apparent and provides "
        "waypoints for the user.\n\n"

        "Motion provides meaning.\n\n"

        "Motion respects and reinforces the user as the prime mover. Primary user actions are "
        "inflection points that initiate motion, transforming the whole design.\n"
        "All action takes place in a single environment. Objects are presented to the user without "
        "breaking the continuity of experience even as they transform and reorganize.\n"
        "Motion is meaningful and appropriate, serving to focus attention and maintain continuity. "
        "Feedback is subtle yet clear. Transitions are efﬁcient yet coherent.\n\n"

        "3D world.\n\n"

        "The material environment is a 3D space, which means all objects have x, y, and z "
        "dimensions. The z-axis is perpendicularly aligned to the plane of the display, with the "
        "positive z-axis extending towards the viewer. Every sheet of material occupies a single "
        "position along the z-axis and has a standard 1dp thickness.\n"
        "On the web, the z-axis is used for layering and not for perspective. The 3D world is "
        "emulated by manipulating the y-axis.\n\n"

        "Light and shadow.\n\n"

        "Within the material environment, virtual lights illuminate the scene. Key lights create "
        "directional shadows, while ambient light creates soft shadows from all angles.\n"
        "Shadows in the material environment are cast by these two light sources. In Android "
        "development, shadows occur when light sources are blocked by sheets of material at "
        "various positions along the z-axis. On the web, shadows are depicted by manipulating the "
        "y-axis only. The following example shows the card with a height of 6dp.\n\n"

        "Resting elevation.\n\n"

        "All material objects, regardless of size, have a resting elevation, or default elevation "
        "that does not change. If an object changes elevation, it should return to its resting "
        "elevation as soon as possible.\n\n"

        "Component elevations.\n\n"

        "The resting elevation for a component type is consistent across apps (e.g., FAB elevation "
        "does not vary from 6dp in one app to 16dp in another app).\n"
        "Components may have different resting elevations across platforms, depending on the depth "
        "of the environment (e.g., TV has a greater depth than mobile or desktop).\n\n"

        "Responsive elevation and dynamic elevation offsets.\n\n"

        "Some component types have responsive elevation, meaning they change elevation in response "
        "to user input (e.g., normal, focused, and pressed) or system events. These elevation "
        "changes are consistently implemented using dynamic elevation offsets.\n"
        "Dynamic elevation offsets are the goal elevation that a component moves towards, relative "
        "to the component’s resting state. They ensure that elevation changes are consistent "
        "across actions and component types. For example, all components that lift on press have "
        "the same elevation change relative to their resting elevation.\n"
        "Once the input event is completed or cancelled, the component will return to its resting "
        "elevation.\n\n"

        "Avoiding elevation interference.\n\n"

        "Components with responsive elevations may encounter other components as they move between "
        "their resting elevations and dynamic elevation offsets. Because material cannot pass "
        "through other material, components avoid interfering with one another any number of ways, "
        "whether on a per component basis or using the entire app layout.\n"
        "On a component level, components can move or be removed before they cause interference. "
        "For example, a floating action button (FAB) can disappear or move off screen before a "
        "user picks up a card, or it can move if a snackbar appears.\n"
        "On the layout level, design your app layout to minimize opportunities for interference. "
        "For example, position the FAB to one side of stream of a cards so the FAB won’t interfere "
        "when a user tries to pick up one of cards.\n\n"
